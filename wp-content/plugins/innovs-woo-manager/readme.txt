== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it free? =

* Yes, it is!

= No changes are seen though I've made changes? Why is that? What could be the possible reason? =
* Please make sure that your theme or child theme is not overriding the specific element you are trying to change. To check, you can switch to a default theme like - Twenty Nineteen and see if it works. In this way, you will be able to find out if this is not working due to any theme related issue- like using !important in CSS code or something else.
